# Print-Server
For the second project in my Operating Systems class (CprE 308), I created a program written in C that sets up a single print server with multiple consumers printing to the server. To start this project, I first learned the topics that were not covered in lecture that were required to solve the problem (various inter-process communication methods). To learn these, I utilized online resources. I then broke down the project into smaller parts and determined what topics could be used to solve the smaller problems. The major topics learned in this project were threading, inter-process communication methods, mutual exclusion, semaphores, conditional variables, sockets, and bash scripting.
